3d: Dependent Data Descriptions for Verified Validation
=======================================================

.. note::

   The documentation from this page covers the EverParse/3d releases
   v2021.03.05 or later. Documentations for earlier versions may be
   found in the Git history.

EverParse/3d lets you write a data format description and
automatically produces efficient data validation code formally
verified for memory-safety (absence of buffer overruns), functional
correctness (validation is correct wrt. your data format) and security
(absence of double memory fetches.) A gentle overview of formal
verification is available in the `documentation of EverCrypt
<https://hacl-star.github.io/Overview.html#what-is-verified-software>`_;
EverParse provides similar formal guarantees except
secret-independence.

Summary
-------

1. Write your data format description in the 3d language, as
   ``MyFile1.3d``, ``MyFile2.3d``.

2. Give MyFile1.3d and MyFile2.3d to EverParse:

   * with the Windows binary package: ``everparse.cmd MyFile1.3d MyFile2.3d``

   * with the Linux binary package: ``everparse.sh MyFile1.3d MyFile2.3d``

   * with the sources: ``bin/3d.exe --batch MyFile1.3d MyFile2.3d``

Then, EverParse/3d produces:

* ``MyFile1.fsti``, ``MyFile1.fst``: the verified F\* specification
  and Low\* implementation of parsers and validators for your data
  format from ``MyFile1.3d``, and similarly for ``MyFile2.3d``

* ``MyFile1.c``, ``MyFile1.h``: the verified C code generated from the verified
  F\* and Low\* files, and similarly for ``MyFile2.3d``

* ``MyFile1Wrapper.c``, ``MyFile1Wrapper.h``: an entrypoint API to call into the
  verified C code, and similarly for ``MyFile2.3d``

* ``EverParse.h``, ``EverParseEndianness.h``: various EverParse
  helpers for the implementation of verified validators, common to
  ``MyFile1.3d`` and ``MyFile2.3d``

3. Insert ``#include "MyFile1Wrapper.h"`` into any of your C
   compilation units that need to call a validator from
   ``MyFile1.3d``, and similarly for ``MyFile2.3d``.

Formal guarantees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each message type in the source data formats, the generated C code
provides a _validator_, a procedure to determine if a given input
array of bytes contains a valid representation of a message, with the
following properties:

* *Memory safety*: The validator is `memory safe <http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2014/07/21/memory-safety/>`_, meaning it never
  accesses memory out of bounds, accesses memory at an incompatible
  type, uses memory after it has been freed, etc.

* *Arithmetic safety*: The validator has no integer overflows or underflows.

* *Double-fetch freedom*: The validator reads every byte in the input array at
  most once, defending against certain kinds of
  `time-of-check/time-of-use <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html>`_ bugs.

* *Write footprint*: The validator does not modify the input array,
  and only modifies memory as described by user-controlled imperative
  actions that are explicit in the specification.

* *No heap allocation*: The validator does not allocate any memory on
  the heap.

* *Functionally correct*: The validator accepts all input arrays that
  contain valid representations of the message according to its
  specification, rejecting all others.

The 3d Dependent Data Description language
------------------------------------------

Download and install
--------------------

We provide binary (amd64 only) packages for Windows and Linux.

1. Download the binary package corresponding to your platform, from
   the `latest EverParse/3d release
   <https://github.com/project-everest/everparse/releases>`_.

2. Extract it (Windows: ``unzip``; Linux: ``tar xzf``) anywhere you
   like. No need to configure it anyhow.

Then, everything is contained in a ``everparse`` directory, whose
actual entrypoint executable is ``everparse.cmd`` (for Windows) or
``everparse.sh`` (for Linux.)

Binary packages already contain all dependencies required by
EverParse, such as F\*, KReMLin and z3, so no need to install anything
beforehand.

The Windows binary package contains a `binary snapshot of clang-format
<https://llvm.org/builds/>`_ to pretty-print the produced ``.c`` and
``.h`` files. On Linux, you may want to install clang-format (more
info at the `LLVM download page
<https://releases.llvm.org/download.html>`_), but this is optional.

The Windows binary package is fully native, in the sense that it does
not require any POSIX emulation layer such as Cygwin or WSL.

Run
---

On Windows: ``everparse.cmd`` [options] input_files

On Linux: ``everparse.sh`` [options] input_files

Default mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Options are treated from left to right:

* ``--odir output_directory_name``

  Tell EverParse to write all files to the directory
  ``output_directory_name``. This directory must already exist
  (EverParse will not create it.) The default is ``.`` (current
  directory)

* ``--batch``

  Verify the produced F\* ``.fst`` and ``.fsti`` files and generate C
  ``.c`` and ``.h`` files. This is toggled by default.

* ``--no_batch``

  Do not verify the produced F\* ``.fst`` and ``.fsti`` files or
  generate C ``.c`` and ``.h`` files.

* ``--clang_format``

  Call ``clang-format`` on extracted .c/.h files. This option
  automatically toggles ``--batch``.

  This is toggled by default on Windows, since the Windows binary
  package contains a copy of clang-format. On Linux, this is toggled
  by default only if ``clang-format`` is reachable through the
  ``PATH`` environment variable.

* ``--no_clang_format``

  Do not call clang-format on extracted .c/.h files.

* ``--clang_format_executable``

  Provide the path to clang-format if not reachable through ``PATH``
  (or to override the one provided in the Windows binary package.)
  This option automatically toggles ``--clang_format`` and
  ``--batch``.

* ``--cleanup``

  With ``--batch``, remove all produced intermediate files other than
  ``.c`` and ``.h` files (thus: ``.fst``, ``.fsti``, ``.checked``,
  ``.krml``)

* ``--no_cleanup``

  Keep all produced intermediate files. This is toggled by default.

Options are treated from left to right, with higher priority on
right-most options. Thus, any ``--no_clang_format`` will override any
occurrence of ``--clang_format`` or ``--clang_format_executable`` to
its left, and vice-versa.

You can provide one or more ``input_files`` to EverParse. They must
all bear the ``.3d`` file name extension, and their names must start
with a capital letter. Then, ``EverParse.h`` and
``EverParseEndianness.h`` will be shared across ``.c`` and ``.h``
files produced for all the ``.3d`` files that you provided.

Alternate mode: generating a Makefile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, with ``--batch``, given a ``.3d`` specification, EverParse
produces ``.c`` and ``.h`` files by first producing ``.fsti`` and
``.fst`` files files containing verified F* specifications and
implementations of validators, and then calling F* and KReMLin on each
such file to verify and extract them to C. EverParse will issue all
such calls to F* and KReMLin sequentially.

Alternatively, with ``everparse.cmd --makefile gmake Test.3d`` (on
Windows; use ``./everparse.sh`` on Linux), instead of producing ``.c``
and ``.h`` files, EverParse will take ``Test.3d`` and all of the
modules it depends on, and produce a GNU Makefile containing all
recipes and rules to produce ``.c`` and ``.h`` files and all
intermediate files with proper dependencies so that the user can
leverage GNU Make parallelism for any rules that do not depend on one
another. Other build systems are supported with variations of the
``--makefile`` option, as stated below.

The produced Makefile will make use of three variables:

* ``EVERPARSE_CMD``: the command to run EverParse. This variable must
  contain the path and name of the EverParse executable, and any
  options (``--clang_format``, etc.) useful to produce .

* ``EVERPARSE_INPUT_DIR``: the path to the input files.

.. note::

  Currently, all ``.3d`` files must be located in the same input
  directory.

* ``EVERPARSE_OUTPUT_DIR``: the path to the output files. EverParse
  will append the ``--odir`` option appropriately.

* ``CC``: the path and name of the C compiler that will be used to
  compile the produced C files.

* ``CFLAGS``: options to provide to the C compiler to compile the
  produced C files.

The produced Makefile, by default called ``EverParse.Makefile``, is
meant to be included in the main ``Makefile`` of your project. On
Linux, such a typical main ``Makefile`` for use with GNU Make may look
like:

.. literalinclude:: Sample.EverParse.Makefile
    :language: make

A fully commented version of that main ``Makefile`` is available `in
the EverParse repository
<https://github.com/project-everest/everparse/blob/master/src/3d/tests/modules/Makefile>`_.

EverParse supports the following command-line options relevant to this
mode:

* ``--makefile gmake``: produce a Makefile for use with GNU Make.

* ``--makefile nmake``: produce a Makefile for use with Microsoft
  NMAKE.

* ``--makefile_name my_file_name``: the name of the produced Makefile
  shall be ``my_file_name`` instead of the default
  ``EverParse.Makefile``.

* ``--skip_o_rules``: do not output rules that would produce ``.o``
  files by compiling ``.c`` files.

Alternate mode: hash checking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To speed up some scenarios where the user maintains a snapshot of the
generated .c and .h files to skip unnecessary verification time when
.3d files are not changed, EverParse provides an optional mechanism to
record the hash of .3d, .c and .h files and to compare them to skip
reverification and regeneration. This mechanism is disabled by
default, and has to be explicitly enabled using the ``--check_hashes``
option as described below.  **WARNING:** this mode will weaken
verification guarantees to the probability of hash collisions!

If enabled, then EverParse checks the hashes of the .3d and maybe .c
and .h files (depending on the variant, as described below) and fails
if hashes do not match; no verification or regeneration is performed
at all.

Hashes are computed and checked using the `EverCrypt
<https://hacl-star.github.io/HaclValeEverCrypt.html>`_ verified
cryptographic library, which is included in EverParse binary packages.

Options relevant to this mode:

* ``--save_hashes``: save the hashes of the contents of source .3d, .c
  and .h files into a .json file. This option can be added in default
  mode when generating .c and .h files.

* ``--check_hashes strong`` : checks the hashes of the contents of
  source .3d, .c and .h files, by reading the recorded hash from the
  .json file created by ``--save_hashes``.

* ``--check_hashes weak`` : checks the hashes of the contents of
  source .3d files only, by reading the recorded hash from the .json
  file created by ``--save_hashes``, leaving the option for the user
  to manually change the generated .c and .h files (**WARNING:** this
  will void all verification guarantees!)

* ``--check_hashes inplace``: same as ``--check_hashes weak``, but
  uses the hash recorded in the copyright header of the generated .c
  and .h files instead of the .json file. The hash is introduced by
  using the ``EVERPARSEHASHES`` keyword in the corresponding
  ``.copyright.txt`` used to prepend generated .c and .h files with
  copyright headers; see `Copyright headers
  <3d-lang.html#adding-copyright-notices-to-produced-c-h-files>`_ for
  more details.

* ``--check_inplace_hash MyFile.3d=MyFile.h``: same as
  ``--check_hashes inplace``, but instead manually specifies the pair
  of the source ``.3d`` file and the already-generated ``.h`` (or
  ``.c``) file in which to check the hash. This option can be
  specified several times to provide several such pairs to check.


Alternate mode: help and version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some options make EverParse do nothing other than show a help or
version message:

* ``--version``

  Print the version of EverParse/3d and exit (do not process any
  further options to the right, nor any files at all.)

* ``--help``

  Show the usage message and the status of some options given so far,
  and exit (do not process any further options to the right, nor any
  files at all.)



Optional: From the sources
--------------------------

You may want to use the sources instead of the binary package in any
of the following cases:

* You are on a non-amd64 platform (however, there is no guarantee that
  the sources will compile under any such non-amd64 platform.)

* You are not on Windows or Linux (however, there is no guarantee that
  the sources will compile under any such non-Windows-Linux system.)

* You want to use your own copy of F\*, KReMLin or z3.

* You want to contribute to EverParse.

To this end, you need to install the dependencies (F\*, KReMLin, z3.)
Fortunately, EverParse, F\* and KReMLin are all components of the
Everest project. Thus, the best way to do that is to use the Everest
script, as described below following the `website of the Everest
project <https://project-everest.github.io/>`_, which EverParse is a
member of:

1. On Windows, you must first `install Cygwin
   <https://www.cygwin.com/>`_.

   Instead, you could also use the `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_ and
   act as if you were on Linux, but this has not been officially
   tested by anyone in the Everest project.

2. Clone the `Everest repository from GitHub
   <https://github.com/project-everest/everest>`_.

3. From inside the origin directory of the clone, run ``./everest
   check`` and follow the instructions on how to install compilation
   dependencies (OCaml, etc.) On Windows (but not WSL), ``./everest
   check`` should automatically install all such compilation
   dependencies, but you may need to re-run it several times after
   refreshing the environment.

4. Run ``./everest z3`` and follow the instructions to install z3 on
   your system.

5. Run ``./everest pull`` to fetch and pull the latest versions of F\*
   and KReMLin.

6. Run ``./everest -j 1 FStar make kremlin make`` to build F\* and
   KReMLin. The ``-j`` option introduces a parallelism factor. You can
   also speed up the build by skipping F\* and KReMLin library proofs
   by setting the ``OTHERFLAGS`` environment variable to
   ``"--admit_smt_queries true"``.

7. Set the ``FSTAR_HOME`` environment variable to the ``FStar``
   subdirectory of your Everest clone, which contains a clone of the
   latest F\*.

8. Set the ``KREMLIN_HOME`` environment variable to the ``kremlin``
   subdirectory of your Everest clone, which contains a clone of the
   latest KReMLin.

9. Everest contains a clone of the EverParse sources in the
   ``quackyducky`` subdirectory. You can work from
   there. Alternatively, you can `clone it yourself
   <https://github.com/project-everest/everparse>`_
   anywhere else.

10. Set the ``QD_HOME`` environment variable to your EverParse clone
    as you chose it.

(if you already have your own copy of F\* or KReMLin, and if you
already know how to build them, then you can skip steps 1 to 6 and set
the environment variables accordingly.)

Then, once you are all set up in your EverParse clone, you can build
3d by ``make 3d``. Then, the EverParse/3d executable will be located
at ``bin/3d.exe``.

.. note::

   You cannot use ``everparse.sh`` or ``everparse.cmd`` from the
   sources. You need to use ``3d`` instead.

``3d`` has the same options as ``everparse.sh`` or ``everparse.cmd``,
with the following caveat: no options are toggled by default (not even
``--batch`` or ``--clang_format``) and you need to provide all options
by hand.

Then, if you want, you can build your own binary package for your own
platform through ``make package``.
