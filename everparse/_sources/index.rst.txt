Verified efficient parsing for binary data formats
==================================================

EverParse is a framework for generating verified secure parsers and
formatters from domain-specific format specification languages.

The framework contains three components:

**LowParse**: At the core of EverParse is *LowParse*, a verified library
of parsing and formatting combinators programmed and verified in F\*.

**3D**: A frontend for EverParse to enable specifying data
formats in an style resembling type definitions in the C programming
language. We have used it to generate message validation code for use
within several low-level C programs.

**QuackyDucky**: A frontend for EverParse that accepts data formats
in a style common to many RFCs. We have used it to generate message
processing code for several networking protocols, including TLS and
QUIC.

EverParse is open-source and available on `GitHub
<https://github.com/project-everest/everparse/>`_. EverParse is part
of `Project Everest <https://project-everest.github.io/>`_.

Releases
--------

We produce public releases under the form of a Windows or Linux
standalone binary (x86_64) package and a platform-independent source
package.

The latest release of EverParse can be found `here <https://github.com/project-everest/everparse/releases>`_.
